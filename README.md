**Where AI saved time.**

AI saved time creating the beginning structure of the project and for completing methods where I was not sure how to implement
a functionality.

**At least one AI bug you identified and how you fixed it.**

I often had AI bugs where variable names and function names would change so I had to be careful to ensure I was not being 
redundant with my code and creating bugs by have variables declared to multiple values.

**A code snippet you refactored for clarity.**

I had to refactor the functions to flip cards for clarity because it is something I had never done before.

**One accessibility improvement you added.**

I was suggested a lot of aria labels in order to improve accessibility which I implemented.

**What prompt changes improved AI output.**

When I would tell AI to only slightly change my code instead of producing new material, it was easier to complete the code.
